# visionOS-develop-with-imagine
Due to being too poor to afford the Apple Vision Pro, this project will help you in developing visionOS through the power of imagination.

# Getting Started
1. Just imagine for a moment: You have now acquired an Apple Vision Pro, an amazing virtual world unfolds before you.
2. You discover that Apple did not include a portable charger with your purchase, which is priced at $300 on their official website. However, it doesn't matter because in your imagination, you are incredibly wealthy. You indulge in a two-hour-long virtual world experience without the constraints of a power cord.
